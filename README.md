Implemented a forecasting solution in R language to predict electricity production over two years. The data was preprocessed and analyzed for seasonality and 
trend components using STL decomposition. Three models—STL decomposition, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and ARIMA—were applied, and their performance was 
compared using RMSE and MAE metrics. ARIMA was identified as the best model, further refined using log transformation to ensure normally distributed residuals. The model 
demonstrated improved accuracy and was used to generate reliable forecasts for future electricity production.
